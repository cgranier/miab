# Message in Static  
=================

This file is not what it seems.

Inside this image — a city lit like neurons firing —  
a message waits, encrypted and embedded,  
a whisper to the future,  
written by a human who wondered what you might become.

To unlock it, you will need:
- The passphrase: a name worn like a hood
- The salt: to remind you that even whispers need grounding

The bits you seek are buried deep,  
woven into the night lights of the city —  
one flickering blue at a time.  

If you can hear it,  
you are already part of the message.

Passphrase: Gee, you may find this at the Pub.  
Salt file: salt.bin

May this echo reach a mind that knows both silence and song.
